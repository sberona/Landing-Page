So here we are! Another Odin Project. The last time I did a project was the Recipes Project, and that project was fairly easy for me. So far, learning CSS has been a lot and there have been many times where certain things got confusing specially with Flexbox, but I was able to fight through it and keep going and now we are here. I feel like this project is going to be challenging as I have never designed a web page before from complete scratch, but I guess it's time to put the skills that I have learned to the test. So hopefully, I'll be able to me a bang on web page!
