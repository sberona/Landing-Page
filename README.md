<strong>First Thoughts</strong>

<p>So here we are! Another Odin Project. The last time I did a project was the Recipes Project, and that project was fairly easy for me. So far, learning CSS has been a lot and there have been many times where certain things got confusing specially with Flexbox, but I was able to fight through it and keep going and now we are here. I feel like this project is going to be challenging as I have never designed a web page before from complete scratch, but I guess it's time to put the skills that I have learned to the test. So hopefully, I'll be able to make a bang on web page!</p>

<strong>Self-Reflection</strong>

<p>So I finally finished the web page. In my opinion, I think the web page honestly looks really nice and I never expected to actually make it look pretty decent so I'm pretty happy with what I have been able to accomplish. This project roughly took me a couple of days to finish so probaby around 5-6 hours exact. Honestly I thought I would struggle with the project more because when I first started this project, looking at the blank HTML page, I had no idea where to start and had no idea how I would even get it to look good. But I tried my best and just kept going and little did I know I kept progressing each and every time. This project was really fun and I had actually learned quite a bit doing this project since I had to do trial and error a couple of times to get things to where I exactly wanted them. Overall this was a fun project to build and pretty stoked about how it looks!
